# Bot_discord
This bot is hosted on the discord platform. 
It is added to the server and 
for now is intended to inform users about 
the channel admin and server rules, and briefly navigate through it.
The bot is able to respond to key phrases and give an answer to them, the makings of a dialogue.

Uses Discord token and API.

There are plans to unite with a music bot, 
which will make it possible to play music directly in the channel.
